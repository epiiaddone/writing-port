        <h1>What Is Bitcoin?</h1>

        <p>
          Bitcoin is the inaugural ‘cryptocurrency’ – a distributed,
          decentralised, digital currency that enables users to transact
          directly with each other without any middle men. Since its inception,
          it’s undergone massive growth to reach a current market capitalisation
          of over $100 billion USD, and can now be used for all kinds of
          purchases, ranging from pizzas to flights.
        </p>

        <p>
          Although Bitcoin has faced heavy criticism for its volatility and use
          in illegal transactions, its usefulness can’t be denied. Aside from
          the obvious financial applications of Bitcoin, the blockchain
          technology that it’s built on is revolutionising all sorts of
          businesses – from healthcare to trade finance.
        </p>

        <p>
          Many critics speculate that Bitcoin is a passing trend that is nearing
          its end. On the contrary, Bitcoin – and crypto-technologies as a whole
          – look set to be a core part of the future.

        <h2>History of Bitcoin</h2>

        <p>
          2009:
          <br />
          Bitcoin is made public and the process of ‘mining’ begins.
        </p>
        <p>
          2010:
          <br />
          The first ever Bitcoin trade occurs over a Bitcoin forum. Up until
          this point, Bitcoins had only been mined.
        </p>
        <p>
          2011:
          <br />
          Bitcoin reaches parity with the dollar (US) in February and then
          quickly exceeds it. By June, 1 Bitcoin is worth $31. The first market
          competitors to Bitcoin – known collectively as ‘altcoins’ – begin to
          appear.
        </p>
        <p>
          2013:
          <br />
          The price of one Bitcoin has reached $1000. At this point, it begins
          to decline and plummets to approximately $300. The People’s Bank of
          China bans financial institutions in China from handling Bitcoin
          transactions.
        </p>
        <p>
          2014:
          <br />
          The US government seizes 29,000 Bitcoins from Silk Road, an online
          drug marketplace, and subsequently auctions them off. Microsoft begins
          to accept payments in Bitcoin.
        </p>
        <p>
          2015 – 2016:
          <br />
          The value of one Bitcoin climbs back up to $770 by June 2016.
          Ethereum, one of Bitcoin’s most successful successors and the second
          largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, is released.
        </p>
        <p>
          2017:
          <br />
          The price of Bitcoin spikes as demand soars and climbs from less than
          $1000 to almost $20,000 by the end of the year.
        </p>
        <p>
          2018:
          <br />
          Prices tanked after January, falling by over 50% by April. It’s been
          speculated that this fall was due to the launch of a Bitcoin futures
          market.
        </p>
        <h2>Bitcoin Uses</h2>
        <p>Bitcoin has many practical uses, including:</p>
        <h3>As an investment vehicle</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>To make purchases with greater anonymity.</li>
          <li>
            To transfer money internationally without incurring expensive fees.
          </li>
          <li>
            To purchase online goods with low transaction cost. Whilst many
            retailers now accept payment in Bitcoin, a large number still don’t.
            Therefore, at present, the use of Bitcoin is largely constrained by
            the limited number of purchasing options. However, the number of
            retailers that accept Bitcoin is growing and this may change in the
            future.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Uses Within Trade Finance</h3>
        <p>
          In addition to the general uses above, Bitcoin – or rather, the
          blockchain technology used in Bitcoin – is potentially very useful in
          trade finance.
        </p>
        <p>
          By using Bitcoins, transaction charges could be reduced by bypassing
          banks. Blockchain technology could also be used to mimic the Letters
          of Credit process and reduce paper trails, allowing for faster, more
          efficient and more secure trade finance processes.
        </p>

        <h2>Advantages and Disadvantages</h2>
        <p>
          Below we outline the main advantages and disadvantages of Bitcoin:
        </p>
        <h3>Advantages</h3>
        <p>
          <strong>Immune to counterfeiting </strong>
          <br />
          Bitcoins are a digital currency and therefore can’t be counterfeited.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Freedom of payment </strong>
          <br />
          International payments can be made instantaneously at any time,
          regardless of bank holidays and other limitations.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Reduced transaction fees</strong>
          <br />
          Bitcoin has no transaction fees but third-party Bitcoin services like
          Coinbase may charge.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Transparent Information</strong>
          <br />
          The blockchain distributes the ledger of transactions publicly, making
          them verifiable at any time.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Pseudonymous transactions</strong>
          <br />
          Bitcoin users have greater anonymity as all transactions are linked to
          a pseudonym. Your personal information is protected.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Payments are irreversible</strong>
          <br />
          Charge-backs aren’t possible with Bitcoin payments, which could be
          considered an advantage for merchants.
        </p>

        <h3>Disadvantages</h3>

        <p>
          <strong>Easily lost</strong>
          <br />
          An unfortunate consequence of storing your currency digitally means
          that if you have a hardware failure or forget your password, there is
          no way to get your lost coins back.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Not widely accepted</strong>
          <br />
          More and more retailers are beginning to accept Bitcoin payments, but
          there’s a long way still to go. Therefore, it can’t yet replace fiat
          currency.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>High volatility</strong>
          <br />
          As an investment vehicle, Bitcoin has a reputation for being
          excessively volatile. Violent price movements can happen in a short
          time frame.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Subject to regulation</strong>
          <br />
          If law enforcement agencies or governments enact more stringent
          regulations on Bitcoins or cryptocurrencies in general, prices could
          fall.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Illegal/Immoral use</strong>
          <br />
          Bitcoin has attracted a lot of negative press for its use in illegal
          and immoral activities, such as for drug trades.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Payments are irreversible</strong>
          <br />
          Users of Bitcoins can’t perform charge-backs. This offers little buyer
          protection.
