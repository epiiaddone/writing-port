              <h1>10 hobbies that make money</h1>

              <p>
                  Getting paid to do something that you love doing anyway is the dream, right? If you asked almost anyone if they’d give up their nine-to-five to pursue their personal hobbies and interest, they’d almost certainly say yes – the only thing getting in the way is money.
</p><p>

                  Except maybe money actually doesn’t have to get in the way at all. There are plenty of ways to make money from hobbies, and you could start monetizing yours today. The only <strong>real</strong> thing getting in your way is your own mind.
</p><p>
                          I’m a firm believer that, with a certain amount of hard work, a little self-belief, and a lot of determination, anything is possible. Start believing that you can do it, and you could transition from your day job to a professional hobbyist in no time at all.
</p><p>
                          That being said, not all hobbies are equal in terms of earning potential. You might have a hard time finding someone willing to pay you for that navel fluff collection you’ve been working on, for example.
</p><p>
                          With that in mind, we’ve put together this list of the top 10 hobbies that make money, all of which are practically goldmines if you’re willing to put in the effort.
</p><p>
                          I’m going to go into a lot of detail on each so feel free to skip past those which you’re not into.
</p><p>
                          Now, let’s get into it!
</p>

                      <h2>1. Writing</h2>
                      <p>
                          Ok, I might be a little bias here, but I’d say that writing is probably the best and easiest way to start 
                          making money from your hobbies. Why? Because the demand for quality writers is super-high right now.
                          </p>
                      <p>
                          We live in a digital age; an age in which content is king. There are literally hundreds of thousands of online businesses, all of which need landing pages, blogs, product descriptions, sales copy, and lots of other types of written content. And for all of that, they need writers.
</p>

                      <p>The demand for writers far outweighs the supply, which means that you can make really good money if you have the ability. If you can write well, with a distinctive voice and good grammar, you can set yourself up as a freelance writer and <strong>earn up to and over $50,000 a year.</strong>
                      </p>
                      <p>
                          Of course, how much you can <strong>really </strong>earn varies from one person to the next. It all comes down to how lucrative the niche you write in is, the type of content you write, your ability, and your experience.
</p>
                      <p>
                          But right now, you’re not a ‘writer’, you’re just someone who enjoys writing. So how do you go about transitioning from a hobbyist to a real, functioning writer?
                          I might be able to provide some insight here. After all, I’m getting paid to write right now, which means I must be a writer, right?
</p><p>
                          As far as I’m concerned, there are basically two ways you can go about it: the easy way and the hard way. Let’s explore both.
</p>

                      <h3>The Easy Way</h3>
                      <p>
                          The easy way is to sign up for a content mill and start earning money right away. I’ll be honest here though
                           – content mills do not pay you what you’re worth. However, if you have no experience, you’ll find it hard 
                           to find clients without them in the beginning.</p>
                           
                           <p>
                          Content mills are essentially websites which connect writers with clients on a large scale. We’ve 
                          written more about them in this blog, but I’ll give you a brief overview again here.</p>
                          <p>
                          Some content mills vet their writers more than others, but most of them will accept writers with little 
                          to no experience. This means the content produced in mills is relatively poor, and the writers are 
                          paid accordingly.</p>
                          <p>
                          Most content mills will pay $0.01 – $0.03 per word. However, even on $0.01 a word, you can still                           
                          make $10 or more per hour if you can write at least 1,000 words an hour. This blog provides some more
                           insight on how much it’s possible to make through them.</p>
                           <p>
                          Here are some content mills which you can sign up for and start getting paid to write straight away 
                          (if you’re accepted):
</p>
                      <ul>
                          <li>ContentGather</li>
                          <li>Scripted</li>
                          <li>Writer Access</li>
                          <li>Crowd Content</li>
                          <li>iWriter</li>
                          <li>Constant Content</li>
                      </ul>

                      <p>
                          I personally started out writing for these kinds of sites, but I’d recommend breaking free from content mills as soon as you can.
</p>
                      <h3>
                          The Hard Way
</h3>
                      <p>
                          The hard way involves cutting out the middleman and finding real clients that pay real money directly.
                           Find someone to pay you to write, and you’re a writer. Easy.</p>
                      <p>
                          Once you’ve landed your first client, you have credentials, and you can use that to find 
                          more clients willing to pay you. The hard part is landing your first client.
                          Before we get into how to do that, here are three words you need to be familiar with:
</p>
                      <h4>
                          Byline
</h4>
                      <p>
                          A byline is basically the part of an article which names the writer. Not all articles are bylined, some are ‘ghostwritten’, which means the writer can’t claim it as their own. They’ve signed a non-disclosure agreement with the person they’ve written for.
</p>

                      <h4>
                          Niche
</h4>
                      <p>
                          Your writing niche is the area that you specialize in. I write about money, so
                           you might say that my niche is ‘personal finance’. A lot of writers have several niches,
                            and some are ‘generalist’ writers who write about anything.</p>
                      <h4>
                          Portfolio
</h4>
                      <p>
                          Your portfolio is a list of your best work for clients to see – kind of like a
                           showcase of what you can do.
To start getting clients that pay good money, you’ll need all three. You’ll need a portfolio of work to 
convince people to hire you; ideally, some of the pieces on your portfolio should have bylines, and they will 
all be in a specific niche to prove that you’re an expert in writing on that topic.</p>
                      <p>
                          The problem is that you won’t have any of this yet as you haven’t started writing. 
                          This can be a bit of a frustrating ‘chicken and egg’ situation, so I’m going to give some
                           practical tips that can help you to build a portfolio of bylined work.</p>
                      <p>
                          Here are some actionable steps you can take to get started:
</p>

                      <p>
                          <strong>Step 1:</strong> Figure out what niche you want to write in.
</p>
                      <p>
                          <strong>Step 2:</strong> Create a website and self-publish some blogs in your niche.</p>
                      <p>
                          <strong>Step 3:</strong> Look for websites relevant to your niche and ask to guest post on their website.</p>
                      <p>
                          <strong>Step 4:</strong> Put your bylined guest posts and self-published blogs into an online portfolio.</p>

                      <p>
                          There’s a lot more too it than that, but I’ve talked too much about writing already,
                          so you’re on your own from here on out.
</p>
                      <p>
                          Now, let’s move on to the next hobby, which is….</p>
                      <h2>
                          2. Reading
</h2>
                      <p>
                          So maybe you don’t like to write, but do you like to read?
                          If so, there’s no shortage of opportunities to monetize those reading skills of yours. Here are three ways you can start getting paid to read:
</p>
                      <h4>
                          Proofread
</h4>
                      <p>
                          Are you the kind of person that can’t stand to see a comma out of place? Someone who understands the technical difference between “uninterested” and “disinterested”, “less” and fewer”, “who” and “whom”? If so, there are lots of companies that would love to sign you up as a proofreader.
</p>
                      <p>
                          Proofreaders can earn anywhere between <strong>$10/hr</strong> and <strong>$65/hr</strong>, depending on how fast and accurate you are.
</p>

                      <h4>
                          Review books
</h4>
                      <p>
                          Ok, so maybe proofreading is a little too technical for some people’s tastes. If you’re looking for something more fun, then consider reviewing books instead.
</p><p>
                      There are various online publications that are willing to pay for book reviews. 
                      There’s also the option of using Fiverr or a similar gig website to reach out to authors who want Amazon reviews of their books – just steer clear of those wanting fakes as this can get your account banned.
</p>
                  <h4>
                      Edit books
</h4>
                  <p>
                      Book editors read through books, correct spelling and grammatical errors,
                       and reword jarring or poorly written sentences. You can find lots of editing gigs 
                       on sites like Upwork and Freelancer.</p>
                  <h2>
                      3. Playing Games
</h2>
                  <p>
                      I recently heard a friend of mine brag that he’d once spent 48 hours straight playing PUBG. Unhealthy habits aside, I couldn’t help but think, <i>imagine how much you could have earned if you’d have spent those hours getting <strong>paid </strong>instead.</i>
                  </p>
                  <h4>
                      Become an Online Video Game Coach</h4>
                  <p>
                      There are lots of online companies that are willing to 
                      employ video game experts as coaches. One of the most popular 
                      examples is GameCoach. To work as an online video game coach for GameCoach, 
                      you’ll need to have a headset with a microphone, webcam, and a solid internet connection.</p>
                  <h4>
                      Become a Game Tester</h4>
                  <p>
                      There are plenty of gaming jobs online for game testers.
                       You can look on regular regional job boards like Indeed and Glassdoor for opportunities
                        in your area. Some companies will also hire remote workers.</p>
                  <h4>
                      Twitch</h4>
                  <p>
                      If you’re going to be playing games anyway, why not stream it live on Twitch? You never know, people might just enjoy watching you and you could join the ranks of professional Twitch streamers. Professional streamers on the platform can make thousands of dollars a week from viewer subscriptions alone.
</p>
                  <h4>
                      Sell Your Gaming Account or In-Game Items.
</h4>
                  <p>
                      If you have a high-level account on a popular MMORPG or lots of expensive in-game items, you may be able to sell them for real money on online marketplaces.
</p>
                  <h4>
                      Sign Up For a Website Which Pays You To Play
</h4>
                  <p>
                      There are lots of websites and apps that will pay you to download and play certain games.
                       These are kind of like paid-to-click sites and don’t typically pay very much, but they may still be
                        worth looking into.</p>
                  <p>
                      If you want a real-life example of just how much money it’s possible to make from simply
                       playing games, look no further than PewDiePie – a YouTuber who rose to fame from playing games and 
                       sharing it with the world and has since earned $155 million in the last 8 years alone according
                        to Money Nation.</p>
                  <p>
                      And whilst we’re on the topic of YouTubers…
</p>

                  <h2>
                      4. Start a YouTube Channel
</h2>
                  <p>
                      If you’re someone who likes to create video content and share your experiences, 
                      
                      you might want to consider starting your own YouTube channel.</p>
                  <p>
                      According to a recent survey, a third of children want to be a YouTuber when they grow up. 
                      The reason for these career aspirations is clear – YouTubers make good money. In fact, the top ten creators on YouTube all made over $10 million each last year alone.</p>
                  <p>
                      Of course, you’re unlikely to make that much unless your channel is hugely successful, 
                      but you can definitely make enough to provide a nice side income whilst doing something you might also enjoy.</p>
                  <p>
                      So exactly how much can you earn from YouTube? The exact answer depends on a lot of different factors,
                       such as the type of content you’re creating, how attractive your channel is to advertisers, and the 
                       revenue streams you open up.
There are multiple ways to earn money from your YouTube channel, such as through:</p>
                  <ul>
                          <li>AdSense revenue</li>
                     <li>Sponsorships</li> 
                      <li>Donations through sites like Patreon</li>
                      <li>Selling merchandise</li>
                     <li>Affiliate links</li> 
</ul>
                  <p>
                      Most YouTubers generate the majority of their income through Adsense revenue. 
                      How much you make from Adsense varies but a good rule of thumb is to estimate around $0.50 per 1,000 video views. This means that, if you were to get 1,000,000 views per month, you’d earn $500.</p>
                  <p>
                      You might be wondering if this is really achievable. With so many would-be YouTubers out there, 
                      it’d be easy to think that you might be too late to the party; that YouTube is now too oversaturated with creators for any new ones to be successful. But is that really true?</p>
                  <p>
                      Well, according to a study published by the International Journal of Research into New Media Technologies,
                       only those creators who are in the top 3% in terms of popularity earn enough from Adsense revenue to make 
                       a living.</p>
                       <p>
That seems disheartening at first glance, I know, but let’s think about it for a moment. The study considered a creator to be 

someone who had uploaded at least 5 videos. They didn’t discriminate between inactive channels or those with really poor content,
 which means that the 97% who weren’t making enough money might have been total rubbish.</p>
                  <p>
                      This actually seems plausible, as the vast majority of people publishing content on YouTube are amateurs
                       with no real knowledge of what it takes to be successful. This means that, if you put the effort in,
                        do your research, and take it seriously, it’s more than possible to reach that top 3%.</p>
                  <p>
                      So how do you go about growing a successful YouTube channel? Well, to start with, you’ll need to think
                       about what type of channel you’d like to create. Here are some popular channel types:
</p>

                  <p>
                      If you consider yourself an artsy person, one crafty way to make money is to start selling the things you make.
                       There are lots of different handmade items that can be sold for a decent profit both online and offline.</p>
                  <p>
                      The best way to go about this is to find something that sells – or that you think should sell 
                      – and start making it. This really could involve anything, whether it’s:</p>
                  <ul>
                      <li>Customizing dolls</li>
                      <li>Adding Swarovski Crystals to Converse</li>
                      <li>Glassblowing unique decorative pieces</li>
                      <li>Making your own Christmas baubles</li>
                      <li>Designing your own fashion line or printed T-shirts</li>
                      <li>‘Upcycling’ furniture</li>
                  </ul>
                  <p>
                      All of the above are real, practical examples of ways that a lot of people are already making 
                      money from crafts. These items can be created by hand and then sold on for a profit. It’s a fun hobby and a 
                      good way to make money.</p>
                  <p>
                      The most popular place to sell handmade products and crafts is on Etsy – a global online
                       marketplace for unique and handmade goods. You can also list them on sites like Amazon and eBay, 
                       or create your own Facebook page or business website and sell them through there.</p>
                  <p>
                      If you’d prefer to sell offline, a great option to look into is local markets. Alternatively, 
                      you can speak to an established retailer and ask them if they’d consider selling them for you.
